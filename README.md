❤️ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes using supervised machine learning techniques. It is a graduation project developed as part of the Computer Science degree program, with a specialization in Data Science.

🔍 Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can save lives. This project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and detect whether a person is likely to have heart disease.

🧠 Features
Input patient health metrics (age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.)
Preprocessing includes outlier handling, encoding, and normalization
Multiple models trained and compared (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix evaluation
Streamlit-based web app interface
